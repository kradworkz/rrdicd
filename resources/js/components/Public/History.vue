                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) IX through its research councils, the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources and Research and Development (PCAARRD) and Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), has been supporting two (2) R&D consortia in the region, namely:1) Western Mindanao Agriculture, Research and Development Consortium (WESMARRDEC) and 2) Zamboanga Consortium for Health, Research and Development Consortium (ZCHRD). While the presence of these research consortia has strengthened the R&D capabilities in the Zamboanga Peninsula region, however, there was an urgent need to create the RRDIC to formulate the Regional R&D agenda specifically addressing the needs of the various sectors in the region; provide policy directions to guide all stakeholders and partners toward a common goal of developing the RDI capability of the region; and foster inter-agency collaboration and partnership in RDI initiatives.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The creation of Zamboanga Peninsula’s RRDICom was based on DOST Resolution No. 2017 – 002, series of 2017, “A Resolution Proposing the Creation of a Regional Research, Development and Innovation under the Regional Development Council and its Corresponding Terms of Reference.”</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">During the General Assembly of the WESMARRDEC held on 29 December 2018 at the Western Mindanao State University (WMSU), DOST IX Regional Director Martin A. Wee informed the body on the proposed organization of the RRDIC under the RDC IX.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The terms of reference on the creation of the RRDICom was presented during the CY 2019 1st regular meeting of the Regional Social Development Committee (RSDC) of RDC IX on 19 February 2019. The RSDC IX favorably endorsed the RRDICom creation by virtue of RSDC IX Resolution No. Resolution No. 006, s. 2019, endorsing to RDC IX the proposed creation of an RRDICom, a special committee under RDC IX.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">During its 165th regular meeting on 14 March 2019, the Council approved the creation of RRDICom under RDC IX through Resolution No. 009, series of 2019. </p>
